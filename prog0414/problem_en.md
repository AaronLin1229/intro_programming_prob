## Problem Description
Read a series of integers from standard input until EOF (End Of File) is reached. Calculate and output the sum of these integers.

## Input Format
A series of integers, one per line, until EOF.

## Output Format
Output a single integer, the sum of all input integers.

## Sample

```input1
1
2
3
```

```output1
6
```

```input2
-1
5
10
```

```output2
14
