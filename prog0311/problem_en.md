## Problem Description
Given three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a potential triangle, determine whether they can form a valid triangle. If they can, output `YES`. Otherwise, output `NO`. Note that the sides do not necessarily follow the order $a \leq b \leq c$.

## Input Format
The input consists of a single line containing three integers, $a, b, c$, representing the lengths of the sides of the potential triangle.

## Output Format
Output a single line containing `YES` if the sides can form a triangle or `NO` if they cannot.

## Sample

```input1
3 4 5
```

```output1
YES
```

```input2
1 2 3
```

```output2
NO
```

## Specification
- $1 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^{6}$
