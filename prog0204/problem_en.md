## Problem Description
Write a program to solve the following problem
There are chickens, rabbits, and crabs in the same cage. Now we have the total amount of the animals $s$, their number of feet in total $f$, and the number of tails in total $t$. Determine the number of chickens, rabbits, and crabs.

## Input Format
The input contains one line with three integers, $s, f, t$ seperated by space.

## Output Format
Output three lines, each line contains an integer. Respectively the numbers of chickens, rabbits, and crabs.

## Sample

```input1
9 48 5
```

```output1
2
3
4
```

## Specification
- $0 \leq s, f, t \leq 2^{31} - 1$.
- The solution is guaranteed to exist
