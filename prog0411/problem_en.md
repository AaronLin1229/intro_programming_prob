## Problem Description

The [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=The%20Collatz%20conjecture%20is%20one,every%20positive%20integer%20into%201.), also known as the $3n + 1$ problem, involves a sequence defined for any positive integer $n$. We define the function $f(n)$ as follows:

$$
f(n) =
\begin{cases} 
n / 2 & \text{if } n \equiv 0 \mod 2\\
3n + 1 & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \mod 2 \\
\end{cases}
$$

Additionally, we define the process of generating the Collatz sequence with the assignment operation as:

$$
n \leftarrow f(n)
$$

This process is repeated, with each subsequent $n$ being the result of the function $f$ applied to the previous $n$, until $n = 1$.

The task is to simulate this sequence for a given initial value of $n$ and output all the terms of the sequence until $n = 1$.

## Input Format

The input will contain a single integer $n$.

## Output Format

Output the sequence of integers generated by repeatedly applying the function $f(n)$ starting from the input $n$, one per line, until $n = 1$.
