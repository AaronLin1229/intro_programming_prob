## Problem Description

In the classic problem known as "FizzBuzz", you are asked to write a program that prints the numbers from $1$ to $N$, but for multiples of $3$ print `Fizz` instead of the number, and for the multiples of $5$ print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both $3$ and $5$, print `FizzBuzz`.

Your task is to write a program that takes an integer $N$ and plays the FizzBuzz game from $1$ to $N$.

## Input Format

A single line containing the integer $N$.

## Output Format

Print the numbers from $1$ to $N$, one per line. But for multiples of $3$, print `Fizz` instead of the number, and for multiples of $5$ print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both $3$ and $5$, print `FizzBuzz`.

## Sample
