## Problem Description

Given an array $A$ of integers where every element appears twice except for one, which appears only once, find and print out this single element.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains $n$ integers describing the elements of array $A$.

## Output Format

Print out the single integer that appears only once in the array.

## Sample
```input1
5
1 2 1 2 3
```

```output1
3
```

```input2
3
4 4 6
```

```output2
6
```

## Specification

- $1 \leq n \leq 10^3, n \text{ is odd}$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9,  1 \leq i \leq n$
- It is guaranteed that there is exactly one element that appears only once.
