## Problem Description

Write a program to find the area of the minimum rectangle (with edges parallel to the axes) to contain a set of points. For example, if you are given the following points $(1,1), (2,3), (7,6), (−2,7), (−4,20), (0,0), (−3,−3)$, then the smallest rectangle to contain all the points is the one that has two corners at $(−4,−3)$ and $(7,20)$. You need to print its area, which is $253$.

## Input Format

You must process all input until EOF. There will be no more than $100$ points, and all computation is in int. All coordinates are between $-10000$ and $10000$, and there will be at least one point.

## Output Format

The final area.

## Sample

```input1
1 1
2 3
7 6
-2 7
-4 20
0 0
-3 -3
```

```output1
253
```
