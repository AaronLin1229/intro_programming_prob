## Problem Description
In this problem, you are given an integer $x$. Your task is to calculate the factorial of $x$ and print it. The factorial of a number is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of $5$ (denoted as $5!$) is $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.

## Input Format
The input consists of a single line containing the integer $x$.

## Output Format
Print a single line containing one integer â€” the factorial of $x$.

## Sample

```input1
5
```

```output1
120
```

```input2
3
```

```output2
6
```

## Specification
- $0 \leq x \leq 20$
