## Problem Description
Write a program that categorizes a single character `ch` into one of four classes. The character's class is determined based on its case (upper or lower) and whether it is a vowel or not.

- If `ch` is an uppercase vowel, print `<ch> is class A`.
- If `ch` is a lowercase vowel, print `<ch> is class B`.
- If `ch` is an uppercase consonant, print `<ch> is class C`.
- Otherwise, print `<ch> is class D`.

Vowels are the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and their lowercase counterparts.

## Input Format
A single line containing the character `ch`.

## Output Format
A single line stating the class of the character.
