# Set of Introduction Problems

This is a compilation of problems that I gathered that would be suitable for beginners to work on. It contains problem statements in English and Maderian, and solutions in C/C++/Python, with testcases. All problems are designed to be solved in C, but any other language in fine. You can write (or ask a LLM to write) a script for you to automate the testing.

Some of the problems are gathered from Judge Girl.
