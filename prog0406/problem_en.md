## Problem Description
In this problem, you are given an integer $x$. Your task is to compute the $x$-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

$$
F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1,\\
F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2} \text{ for } n \geq 2.
$$

## Input Format
A single line containing the integer $x$.

## Output Format
Print a single line containing the $x$-th Fibonacci number.

## Sample

```input1
3
```

```output1
2
```

```input2
5
```

```output2
5
```

## Specification
- $0 \leq x \leq 45$
