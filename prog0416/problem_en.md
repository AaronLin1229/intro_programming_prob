## Problem Description
Given a very large number $N$, determine whether it's a multiple of $11$. The challenge here is to work with numbers much larger than those typically handled in programming, specifically in the range of $0 \leq N \leq 10^{1024}$.

## Input Format
A single line containing the large number $N$.

## Output Format
Print `YES` if the number is a multiple of $11$, otherwise print `NO`.

## Sample

```input1
11111111111111111111
```

```output1
YES
```

```input2
9000000009000000009
```

```output2
NO
```

## Specification
- $0 \leq N \leq 10^{1024}$
