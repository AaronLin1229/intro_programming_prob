## Problem Description

Write a program to compute the number of 1's in their binary representation. For instance, $7$ has three $\text{1}$'s since its binary representation is $\text{00000111}$. Similarly, $25$ also has three $\text{1}$'s because its binary representation is $\text{00011001}$.

## Input Format

A set of positive integers no more than $2147483647$, one per line. You must process them until EOF (End Of File).

## Output Format

The number of 1's in the binary representation of the input integer, one per line.

## Sample

```input1
1
3
5
7
127
2147483647
```

```output1
1
2
2
3
7
31
```

## Specification

- The input consists of multiple lines, each containing one positive integer $N$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 2147483647$.
