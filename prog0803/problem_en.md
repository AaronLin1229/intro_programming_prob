## Problem Description

Write a program to compute the number of $\text{1}$'s in the binary representation of given integers. For example, the number $7$ has three $\text{1}$'s since its binary representation is $\text{00000111}$. Similarly, $25$ has three $\text{1}$'s because its binary representation is $\text{00011001}$.

## Input Format

A set of positive integers no more than $9223372036854775807$, one per line. The input is terminated by the end-of-file (EOF).

## Output Format

For each input integer, output the number of $1$'s in its binary representation, one result per line.

## Sample

```input1
1
3
5
7
127
2147483647
9223372036854775807
```

```output1

```

## Specification

The input consists of several positive integers, each less than or equal to $9223372036854775807$.
